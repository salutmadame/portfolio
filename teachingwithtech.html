							<h2>Writing Workshop</h2>
							<p>Education policy in Ontario emphasizes students’ development of 21st century competencies. Collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking are fostered in many different settings, often paired with an emphasis on capacity-building using digital technologies.</p> 
<p>As devices and born-digital learning environments are accepted as a matter of course, critical media literacy is a key component of growing digital citizenship in classroom communities. Being able to assess the ways in which technologies impact our teaching and learning, especially as new EdTech seems to appear every day, should be a part of every student’s learning at school.</p> 
<p>This alphabet book, made using Canva and Book Creator, was a playful, irreverent way for me to simultaneously learn more about the limitations of EdTech while experiment with online publishing tools. 
What parts of ourselves do we give up in the name of streamlining assessment or lesson delivery? How are corporations becoming responsible for pedagogy? Just how hot are my takes? Read on and see!

							<h2>3D Printing and Design</h2>
							<p>My interest in working with 3D printing started in 2015, so I was a little late to the game. I got a job at Studio 307, the first iteration of the Faculty of Information’s maker space, and got hooked quick! </p>
<p>After the novelty of watching plastic extrude from a super hot nozzle for several hours to make a palm-sized plastic shape wore off, exploring the possibilities and limitations of 3D modelling software became my next project.</p>
<p>I have been instructing learners ages 8 and up in 3D design using Autodesk Fusion 360 since 2016. Helping people realize their visions for simple objects and taking them through the printing process has not lost its charm!</p>

							<h2>Bringing Art to Life</h2>
							<p><p>This project is called<i> Reconstruire l’avenir – Interactive Mixed Media Collage as Creative Disruption.</i> I began developing it in winter 2020 as a way to engage with human impact on the earth through multiple modes of expression.</p>
<p> This project used Scratch, Makey Makey, and conductive household materials, in addition to a class set of Chromebooks, to animate collages that responded to various open questions about Canada’s role in mining, forestry, fisheries, and oil and gas on local and global scales. </p>
<p> Working across disciplines to communicate ideas about a common theme was an effective tool to grow and assess student understandings of their lived experiences of and opinions about resource extraction. </p>

							<h2>Integration with Placemaking</h2>
							<p><p> Respect and stewardship of local living and non-living systems allows students to build connections with the places where they play and learn. Taking a placemaking approach to making meaning with children prioritizes the stories that they want to tell about their school and community.</p>
<p>Adding elements of augmented reality (AR) to a project accesses multimodal ways of sharing knowledge. By incorporating a QR code into a physical, real-world environment, any given element can be given another dimension by connecting to computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, or graphics.</p>
<p>This project used the app Vocaroo to record audio input and generate a QR code to add voice to inanimate objects around the OISE campus. We incorporated our interest in Environmental and Sustainability Education to tell our object’s story of place.</p>

							<h2>Storying Learning</h2>
							<p><p>Publishing work for an audience lends a certain gravitas to your learning. When students work with blogs, they can engage in collaborative, creative writing processes using technological tools that they might encounter in their daily lives. Developing and sharing a personal voice is an effective way to promote inquiry and inspire a love of learning.</p>
<p>As a student, I have had meaningful experiences storying my own learning. In particular, working with archival materials in various contexts has led to rich explorations of what it means for me to learn and the extent to which I can make inferences from objects.</p>
<p>In 2016, I was lucky to be able to work on an exhibit for the Toronto Ward Museum called <i>Finding Myself in the Archive.</i> The project paired graduate students with an archival object and asked us to write stories about the materials we selected. A delightful bit of foreshadowing – my object came from the OISE library.</p>

							<h2>Video Histories</h2>
							<p><p>Telling stories using technology is certainly a theme of my work with digital tools. Working with video via Adobe Spark let me revisit and subsequently re-envision how I communicated the results of the capstone project of my Master of Museum Studies degree.</p>
<p><i>Looking back, going forward</i> was my attempt at cataloguing and digitizing the personal archive of my great great grandfather, Harlan Smith. Making this video allowed me to communicate the results of my research in a different way, and gave me something to share more widely with my family to start a conversation about both our history and the future of the documents.</p>

							<h2>Green Screen</h2>
							<p><p>Ah, the dog in the little hat willfully ignoring the absolute devastation around him as he drinks his coffee! Truly an iconic image of our time! And with cheap, easily accessible green screen technology (a table cloth and the app DoInk), it could show up anywhere!</p>
<p>I chose to put the image of the lil guy drinking coffee in a fire on a coffee cup because I found it amusing, but if you want a grad school answer about it: memes are postmodern texts that draw heavily from the already-said, and are examples of intertextual hybridities that explore contemporary life and culture in an ironic or parodic way.</p>
<p>And while it is my firm belief that I can defend this image intellectually, it’s the emotional impact that really drives things home. Are we not all, in some ways, like this little dog? Do we not all want to drink hot beverages as our worlds fall apart?? </p>
<p>Who can say.</p>

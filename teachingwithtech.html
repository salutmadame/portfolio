							<h2>Publishing</h2>
							<p>Education policy in Ontario emphasizes students’ development of 21st century competencies. Collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking are fostered in many different settings, often paired with an emphasis on capacity-building using digital technologies.</p> 
<p>As devices and born-digital learning environments are accepted as a matter of course, critical media literacy is a key component of growing digital citizenship in classroom communities. Being able to assess the ways in which technologies impact our teaching and learning, especially as new EdTech seems to appear every day, should be a part of every student’s learning at school.</p> 
<p>This alphabet book, made using Canva and Book Creator, was a playful, irreverent way for me to simultaneously learn more about the limitations of EdTech while experiment with online publishing tools. 
What parts of ourselves do we give up in the name of streamlining assessment or lesson delivery? How are corporations becoming responsible for pedagogy? Just how hot are my takes? Read on and see!

							<h2>3D printing and design</h2>
							<p>My interest in working with 3D printing started in 2015, so I was a little late to the game. I got a job at Studio 307, the first iteration of the Faculty of Information’s maker space, and got hooked quick! </p>
<p>After the novelty of watching plastic extrude from a super hot nozzle for several hours to make a palm-sized plastic shape wore off, exploring the possibilities and limitations of 3D modelling software became my next project.</p>
<p>I have been instructing learners ages 8 and up in 3D design using Autodesk Fusion 360 since 2016. Helping people realize their visions for simple objects and taking them through the printing process has not lost its charm!</p>

							<h2>Bringing Art to Life</h2>
							<p><p>This project is called<i> Reconstruire l’avenir – Interactive Mixed Media Collage as Creative Disruption.</i> I began developing it in winter 2020 as a way to engage with human impact on the earth through multiple modes of expression.</p>
<p> This project used Scratch, Makey Makey, and conductive household materials, in addition to a class set of Chromebooks, to animate collages that responded to various open questions about Canada’s role in mining, forestry, fisheries, and oil and gas on local and global scales. </p>
<p> Working across disciplines to communicate ideas about a common theme was an effective tool to grow and assess student understandings of their lived experiences of and opinions about resource extraction. </p>
